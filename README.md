# An Empirical Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for the Detection of Forged Banknotes


## Abstract
This paper seeks to compare the performance of different machine learning methods (stochastic gradient
descent, k-nearest neighborsâ€™ classifier, decision tree classifier, logistic regression) employed to detect the forgery
of banknotes and determine the most suitable method for the detection of forged or counterfeit banknotes.
